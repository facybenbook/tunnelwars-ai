# Tunnel Wars AI Final Project

To get started:
1. Download Unity
2. Open Assets/Scene.unity

The main logic of the game is all crammed into Game.cs. The AI addition will add classes used by this main script.

#### Style conventions
* camelCase for normal variables
* PascalCase for (public) class methods
* Put public (used by other classes) methods towards the top of the file so they are easy to spot at first glance
* `// Capitalize`
* `private` is default more or less, so no need to put it
