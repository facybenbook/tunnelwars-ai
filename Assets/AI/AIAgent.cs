/*
 * AIAgent.cs
 * 
 * This agent is responsible for the AI. It operates at 3 levels:
 * 
 * 	Level 1 - Short-term discretized adversarial search
 * 		State space: World's (without powerup spawning)
 * 		Action space: WorldActions (keypresses)
 * 		Transition model: Advancement of real gameplay
 * 		Action model: Valid key actions
 * 		Terminal state: Winning (1) or losing (-1)
 * 		Heuristic: Strategy-weighted World evaluation + Level 2 conformance
 * 
 * Level 2 - Bloxel-level classical A* search
 * 		State space: BlockWorld's
 * 		Action space: Simplified directions
 * 		Transition model: Move in direction, taking out block if necessary
 * 		Goal state: Strategy specific
 * 		Action model: Must have ammo to blow out blocks. Must have walls if climbing
 * 		Cost function: Step number, Strategy-weighted BlockWorld evaluation (dominate)
 * 		Heuristic: Distance (Euclidean if above ground)
 * 
 * Level 3 - Q-learned strategy selection
 * 		State space: SimplifiedWorld's
 * 		Action space: Strategy
 * 		Transition model: Set strategy
 * 		Action model: All, except only dig down once.
 * 		Reward function: Delta health, winning the game (dominating term)
 *
