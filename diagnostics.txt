Rough size of World type:
2872 bytes

Depth first memory consumption:
n = 4: b * n * sizeof(World) = 4 * 4 * 2872 = 11,488 bytes = 45 KB (Not much)

Breadth first memory consumption:
n = 4: b ^ n * sizeof(World) = 4 ^ 4 * 2872 = 735,232 bytes = 735 KB (Not much)
n = 6 is 11.76 MB. Roughly 1/680th of available memory

Speed up ideas:
- During player CheckAction and then Advance, the same walls are checked twice - first during CheckAction then during Advance. Cache result and use it again.
